This project aims to provide rankings toward players' offensive output over the years for the Papillion Lavista Pinnacle Bank American Legion Monarch baseball team.

Using 4 equally weighted components, a final tjScore is calculated (ranges from 0 to 4) to determine the "best" and "worst" offensive seasons from Monarch baseball players over the last 15+ years (2007-2024).

The following 4 components were taken into account for tjScore calculations:
    1) Plate discipline
    2) Isolated power
    3) Run contribution
    4) Clutch factor

Results can be found in "monarch top seasons.csv", and are ordered by best to worst season. This highlights topics such as data manipulation, data processing, web scraping, statistical work and parallel processing.
